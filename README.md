# Espruino IDE for VS Code

A VT100 Serial Terminal as a VS Code extension- designed for writing code on microcontrollers that use the [Espruino JavaScript interpreter](http://www.espruino.com).

This is a VS Code application that uses [serialport](https://www.npmjs.com/package/serialport) to access your PC's serial port. It is based on the Chrome web application [Espruino Web IDE](https://github.com/espruino/EspruinoWebIDE).

It implements basic VT100 terminal features (up/down/left/right/etc) - enough for you to write code using the Espruino. You can also use the code area to write JavaScript code on the PC, and can then click the 'transfer' icon to send that code directly down the Serial Port.
